# Pattern Matching

HVM-Lang offers pattern matching capabilities. You can use pattern matching in defining rules and with the `match` expression.

In example, definitions are a syntax sugar to match expressions:
```rust
(Foo 0 false (Cons h1 (Cons h2 t))) = (A h1 h2 t)
(Foo 0 * *) = B
(Foo 1+n false *) = n
(Foo 1+n true *) = 0

Foo = @arg1 @arg2 @arg3 match arg1 arg2 arg3 {
  (Foo 0 false (Cons h1 (Cons h2 t))): (A h1 h2 t)
  (Foo 0 * *): B
  (Foo 1+n false *): n
  (Foo 1+n true *): 0
}
```

Pattern matching on numers has two forms.
With the successor pattern it will expect a sequence of numbers up to the `n+var` pattern:
```rust
match n {
  0: A
  1: B
  ...
  n+var: (N var)
}

// Becomes:
match n {
  0: A
  1+p: match p {
    ...
    1+var: (N var)
  }
}
```

With the wildcard pattern you can use any number freely:
```rust
match n {
  23: A
  6343: B
  0: C
  ...
  var: (N var)
}

// Becomes:
match (- n 32) {
  0: A
  1+n:
    let n = (+ (+ n 1) 23); match (- n 6453) {
    ...
    1+var: let n = (+ (+ n 1) N-1); (N var)
  }
}
```

Match on tuples become let tuple destructors, which are compiled to a native tuple destructor in hvm-core.
```rust
match x {
  (f, s): s
}

// Becomes:
let (f, s) = (1, 2); s
```

Match on vars becomes a rebinding of the variable with a let expression.
```rust
match x {
  c: (Some c)
}

// Becomes:
let c = x; (Some c)
```

Pattern matching on strings and lists desugars to a list of matches on List/String.cons and List.String.nil
```rust
Hi "hi" = 1
Hi _ = 0

Foo [] = 0
Foo [x] = x
Foo _ = 3

// Becomes:
Hi (String.cons 'h' (String.cons 'i' String.nil)) = 2
Hi _ = 0

Foo List.nil = 0
Foo (List.cons x List.nil) = x
Foo _ = 3
```

Match on ADT constructors can change based on the current encoding.
```rust
data Maybe = (Some val) | None

match x {
  (Some val): val
  None: 0
}

// If the current encoding is 'adt-tagged-scott' it becomes:
#Maybe (x #Maybe.Some.val Î»val val 0)

// Otherwise, if the current encoding is 'adt-scott' it becomes:
(x @val val 0)
```

If constructor fields are not specified, we implicitly bind them based on the name given in the ADT declaration.
```rust
data Maybe = (Some value) | None

match x {
  Some: x.value
  None: 0
}

// Becomes:
match x {
  (Some x.value): x.value
  (None): 0
}
```

Nested pattern matching allows for matching and deconstructing data within complex structures.
```rust
data Tree = (Leaf value) | (Node left right)

match tree {
  (Node (Leaf a) (Leaf b)): (Combine a b)
  (Node left right): (Merge left right)
  Leaf: (Single tree.value)
}

// Becomes:
match tree {
  (Node left right): match left {
    (Leaf a): match right {
      (Leaf b): (Combine a b)
      _: (Merge left right)
    }
    _: (Merge left right)
  }
  (Leaf value): (Single value)
}
```
