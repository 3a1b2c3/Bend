Errors:
In definition 'main':
  Irrefutable 'match' expression. All cases after variable pattern 'true' will be ignored.
  Note that to use a 'match' expression, the matched constructors need to be defined in a 'data' definition.
  If this is not a mistake, consider using a 'let' expression instead.
